<h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Thrift ed, your go-to place for affordable and quality thrifted items!We are located at Block 3 Lower Manggahan, Balulang, Cagayan de Oro City,and we're proud to say that our business was born out of a passion for thrifting and the desire to share our finds with others.<br><br>

      My name is Eduardo Subsuban Jr., and I am the owner of Thrift ed. I've always had a love for thrift shopping or "ukay-ukay," as it's called here in the Philippines.Over time, I realized that I could turn my hobby into a business and help others discover the joy of thrifting. And that's how Thrift ed came to be!<br><br>
      
      At Thrift ed, we believe in the importance of recycling and reusing items.By purchasing secondhand clothing and other goods, we help reduce waste and minimize our impact on the environment. Plus, thrifted items are often unique and have a special story to tell, adding to their charm and character.<br><br>

      Thank you for visiting Thrift ed. We hope you find something special here and that you'll join us in our mission to promote sustainable fashion and reduce waste.</p>
